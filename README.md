# restaurant-order-system
## Final assignment for COMP 2406

Description:
Restaurant ordering system designed to take users orders. Users can place orders from three different restaurants and will be shown a total price with tax and delivery before submitting their orders. Users can be created with a simple login and password and each user's profile can be set to either a private or public setting where the user can decide if their profile is visible to other users. A user with a public profile displays a list of their order history while a private user is not visible to any other users (including their order history). Restaurants can also display the users (whom are public) that have placed orders.
